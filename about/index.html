</code></pre><p>Why not share my journey with others? Inspire others to follow the same route I took, and have a intellectually educational adventure with it? I want to share with everyone what I have learnt and I want to share the experience with you and anyone else who may come across my blog. All the knowledge I have taken from around the Internet and that has been processed through my brain can be shared within this blog and towards anyone who is interested in the same careers and jobs as me.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for taking the time to stop by this blog. I hope that you find it helpful with whatever brought you here, and that you can also share your experience with others as well.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
